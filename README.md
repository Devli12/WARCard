# WARCard
The game of WAR is a classic card game that is typically played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards. The objective of the game is to beat the opponent by having a higher-ranking card in each round. The game is based on the concept of having a battle between two players, with each player playing a card from their deck and comparing the ranks of the cards. The player with the higher-ranking card wins the round and earns a point, while the losing card is added to a win pool. 

This game is a great way to teach children about strategy and competition, while also helping to improve their memory and cogitive skills. Also, the random chance element of the game adds a level of excitement and unpredictability, making it a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages.

Welcome to the game of WAR! This Java program implements a simple text-based version of the classic card game "WAR" between a player and the computer.

### Rules of the Game

2. On each round, the top card from each player's deck is drawn and compared.
3. The card with the higher rank wins the round.
4. In case of a tie, both cards are added to a "win pool," and the next round becomes a "war."
5. During a war, the winner takes all the cards in the win pool.
6. The game continues until one player runs out of cards or after 100 rounds.
7. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

#### Hard Mode

In Hard Mode, the game adds some extra challenges:

1. After every 30 rounds, if the player's points are greater than or equal to 15, the player's points are reset to 0, making it more challenging.
2. The player's deck has a random chance of being swapped with the computer's deck at the beginning of a round.

#### Trivia Quiz (Hard Mode Only)

In Hard Mode, before starting the game, the player must answer a Star Wars trivia quiz:

### Gameplay

The game will show a text-based interface that prompts the player to pull a card from the deck. Press any letter to draw a card and proceed with the round. The game will display the results of each round, including the winner and the number of cards in each player's deck.

### Game End

The game ends when either the player or the computer runs out of cards or after 100 rounds. At the end of the game, the program will display the winner based on the number of points accumulated.
